## Credit Score Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict credit scores based on various financial attributes. The goal is to develop a model that can assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

**Motivation:**

Many individuals struggle with managing their finances, and credit scores, while valuable for assessing financial health, lack predictive power. This project aims to bridge that gap.

**Objective:**

* Evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning models for credit score classification.
* Identify the most accurate model for predicting credit scores.
* Assist financial institutions in informed decision-making through creditworthiness assessment. 

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Clean data by removing errors, outliers, and handling missing values.
   * Encode categorical features for machine learning compatibility.
   * Apply feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize training. 
   * Address class imbalance, if present, to ensure balanced representation of credit score categories.

2. **Model Training:**
   * Train various machine learning models, including:
      * Logistic Regression
      * Decision Trees
      * Neural Networks
      * Random Forest
      * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
   * Additionally, explore Stacking Classifiers, which combine predictions from multiple models.

3. **Evaluation:**
   * Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
      * Accuracy: Overall classification correctness
      * Precision: Proportion of true positives among identified high credit scores
      * Recall: Proportion of actual high credit scores correctly identified
      * F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

4. **Feature Importance Analysis (Optional):**
   * Utilize a model like Random Forest to identify the most impactful features for credit score prediction.
   * Visualize feature importance to understand which factors contribute most to the model's predictions.
