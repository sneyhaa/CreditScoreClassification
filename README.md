# Credit Score Classification

This project aimed to compare model performances for a credit score classification task. With 28 features to work with, a significant portion of the project was devoted to data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the data was suitable for model building. Feature engineering was a crucial aspect of the project, followed by comparing various model building techniques to identify the best-suited methods for the problem statement.
